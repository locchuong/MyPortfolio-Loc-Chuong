# My Portfolio
A responsive ReactJS portfolio site detailing my skills and experience. I incorporated Material UI (Front-end framework) to support object-oriented design and re-usability. This was my first time using Material UI so there was a lot of hiccups along the way, but I personally learned a lot from this project.
